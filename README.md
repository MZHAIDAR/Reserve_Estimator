🛢️ #Oil & Gas Reserves Estimation App

This is an interactive Streamlit web application built for estimating hydrocarbon reserves using Monte Carlo simulation, Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), and Net Present Value (NPV) modeling. 

🔧 **Features**

🎲 **Monte Carlo Simulation**

Estimate oil or gas in place using input uncertainty on parameters like area, thickness, porosity, water saturation, formation volume factor (FVF/Bg), and recovery factor.

📉 **Decline Curve Analysis (DCA)**

Analyze production decline using exponential, harmonic, and hyperbolic models with cumulative production charts.

💰 **Net Present Value (NPV) Model**

Evaluate project economics using monthly cash flow calculations based on simulated production, price, costs, and discount rate.
