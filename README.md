🛢️ Oil & Gas Reserves Estimation App

This is an interactive Streamlit web application built for estimating hydrocarbon reserves using Monte Carlo simulation, Decline Curve Analysis (DCA), and Net Present Value (NPV) modeling. 

🔧 Features

🎲 Monte Carlo Simulation

Estimate oil or gas in place using input uncertainty on parameters like area, thickness, porosity, water saturation, formation volume factor (FVF/Bg), and recovery factor.

📉 Decline Curve Analysis (DCA)

Analyze production decline using exponential, harmonic, and hyperbolic models with cumulative production charts.

💰 Net Present Value (NPV) Model

Evaluate project economics using monthly cash flow calculations based on simulated production, price, costs, and discount rate.
